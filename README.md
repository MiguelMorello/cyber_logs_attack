# Cybersecurity Threat Detection and Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing cybersecurity events and network traffic data collected between **2018 and 2024**. Using a rich dataset of real-world corporate environments, the analysis provides valuable insights into threat detection, system patch status, and the frequency and severity of attacks. Various visualizations and analyses were implemented to highlight key patterns and trends in cybersecurity incidents.

## Overview

The project explores a **Cybersecurity Threat Detection and Awareness Program Dataset** covering events over six years (2018-2024). By leveraging **data visualizations** and **analysis techniques**, the project aims to improve threat detection, understand system vulnerabilities, and enhance cybersecurity awareness.

---

## Dataset

- **Title:** Cybersecurity Threat Detection and Awareness Program Dataset (2018-2024)  
- **Description:** A comprehensive collection of cybersecurity incidents, including normal and malicious network activity.  
- **Source:** Real-world corporate environments in Texas, USA.  
- **Contents:**
   - Network traffic logs  
   - System logs  
   - Threat intelligence feeds  
- **Features:**
   - Attack severity levels  
   - Attack types (DDoS, Brute Force, SQL Injection, etc.)  
   - System patch status (Updated vs. Outdated)  
   - Incident timestamps  

---

## Project Features

The project includes:  

1. **Severity Distribution Analysis:** Examining the distribution of attack severities (Low, Medium, High).  
2. **Incident Trends Over Time:** Identifying trends in incident occurrences over time.  
3. **Attack Type Analysis:** Comparing attack vectors (e.g., DDoS, Brute Force) across severity levels.  
4. **System Patch Status Comparison:** Assessing the proportion of updated vs. outdated systems.  

Each feature is visualized using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to facilitate interpretation.

---

## Code Implementation

The implementation involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**  
   - The dataset is loaded using `pandas`.  
   - Dates are converted for proper time-based analysis.

2. **Visualization Functions**  
   - Four distinct functions were created to generate visualizations:
     - Attack severity distribution  
     - Incident trends over time  
     - Attack types by severity  
     - Patch status comparison  

3. **Libraries Used**  
   - `pandas`: For data manipulation.  
   - `matplotlib`: For creating line and bar charts.  
   - `seaborn`: For enhanced visualizations and styling.  

**Code Snippet:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('/path/to/cyber.csv')

# Plot Attack Severity Distribution
def plot_attack_severity_distribution(data):
    severity_counts = data['Attack_Severity'].value_counts()
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.barplot(x=severity_counts.index, y=severity_counts.values, palette="viridis")
    plt.title('Attack Severity Distribution')
    plt.xlabel('Severity')
    plt.ylabel('Count')
    plt.show()

# Call the function
plot_attack_severity_distribution(data)
```

---

## Visualizations

The project generated the following visualizations:

1. **Attack Severity Distribution:**  
   - Displays the frequency of low, medium, and high-severity attacks.  

2. **Incidents Over Time:**  
   - Illustrates the trend of incidents between 2018 and 2024.  

3. **Attack Types by Severity:**  
   - Compares attack types (DDoS, Brute Force, SQL Injection) based on severity levels.  

4. **System Patch Status:**  
   - Highlights the disparity between updated and outdated systems.

---

## Key Insights

- **Attack Severity:** Most attacks have a **Low** severity, followed by **Medium** and **High**.  
- **Incidents Trend:** The frequency of incidents remains relatively consistent, with minor variations.  
- **Attack Types:** DDoS attacks dominate the dataset across all severity levels.  
- **System Vulnerabilities:** A significant number of systems (~20%) remain outdated, increasing exposure to cyber threats.  

---

## Results and Conclusions

The analysis revealed that **Low-severity attacks** are the most common, while **High-severity attacks** occur less frequently but pose critical risks. DDoS attacks account for the largest share of incidents, underscoring the need for robust protection mechanisms. Additionally, outdated systems remain a concern, as they increase vulnerabilities and reduce an organization's resilience to cyber threats.

### Key Takeaway:  
Organizations must prioritize **system patching**, focus on detecting high-impact attacks, and invest in proactive cybersecurity strategies to mitigate threats effectively.
